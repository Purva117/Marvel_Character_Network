# MCU Characters Network Visualization

## Project Description

This project is an interactive network visualization of MCU characters, designed to provide an engaging way to explore the relationships and characteristics of various characters from the Marvel Universe. The visualization is created using D3.js, an open-source JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.

## Features

- Interactive Nodes: Each Marvel character is represented as a node in the network. When a user clicks on a node, detailed information about the character is displayed, including their centrality stats of the network and appearances in movies.
- Character Information: The sidebar displays detailed information about the selected character, including their degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality stats, list of movies they appeared in, and top correlated characters.
- Tooltips: Hovering over a node displays a tooltip with a brief summary of the character.

## How to Use

- Clone the Repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/Purva117/Marvel_network.git`
- Open the Project: Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in a web browser.

## Future Enhancements
